Problem Statement: Personal-ised Finance Tracker 


The Problem Most financial tools today are built for record-keeping, not for how people actually make decisions. Bank apps, SMS alerts, UPI notifications, and spreadsheets assume that:

Everyone wants to look at transactions the same way.

Everyone understands tables and categories.

Everyone can translate numbers into meaning.

So people are forced to:

Scroll through endless transaction lists to find what went wrong.

Manually tag, group, and reconcile expenses.

Guess what is "too much" or "unusual".

Discover problems only after the money is gone.

When something feels off, there is no natural way to zoom in, compare, simulate, or ask "what changed?".

The data is there, but the understanding is not. As a result, managing money becomes stressful and reactive. People spend their energy navigating apps instead of making confident decisions.



The Challenge
Reimagine what it feels like to understand your money. Instead of forcing users through static reports, build a conversational financial co-pilot that reshapes itself around the user's question and situation.


Your goal is to create an assistant that:

Can gather data from sources like bank statements, Emails, Messages etc.

Understands natural language questions about money.

Chooses the best way to explain an answer (charts for trends, breakdowns for categories, timelines for spend, comparisons for decisions).

Breaks confusing financial data into clear, focused views.

Lets users zoom in, filter, and explore when something looks wrong.

Adapts its UI as the conversation evolves.

Helps users move from "What is happening?" to "What should I do?".

The experience should feel like a financial partner that sees patterns for the user, not just a search box on top of a ledger. You are not building a full accounting system. You are building a new way of understanding money.


Scope Guidance
To keep the project focused and achievable, go deep into one persona.

Choose one primary persona:

Solo traveler tracking trip spending.

Household manager running shared bills.

Small vendor handling daily cash flow.

Roommates splitting expenses.

Or your own.

Your prototype should demonstrate:

How the system interprets vague questions.

How it turns raw transactions into visual understanding.

How it detects patterns, anomalies, or shifts.

How it guides the user toward a better decision.

How the UI changes as the user digs deeper.

A tight loop is better than a wide one: Ask → See → Explore → Understand → Decide.

What "Good" Looks Like
Your app should feel like a thinking financial partner, not a reporting tool. It should:

Show the right chart or view at the right moment.

Ask smart follow-up questions when intent is unclear.

Let users compare, simulate, and explore scenarios.

Surface insights, surprises, and risks.

End conversations with clarity and agency.

Data & Technical Requirements
Data for your app: Participants may use mock data (e.g., csv file containing transactions) to build and demonstrate their prototype. Using real data is encouraged but not required. Judging will focus on how effectively the UI communicates financial insight, rather than on the size or realism of the dataset.


Prototype Technical Requirements:

Teams must use Thesys CI to generate dynamic, interactive UI in real time as part of the conversational experience.

Each team is eligible for $100 in free Thesys credits to build and run their prototype.

Request credits by filling out this form: https://tally.so/r/QKRMrg.

Judging Criteria
1. AI-Native Experience (50%) Does the system feel like an intelligent financial co-pilot rather than a chatbot or dashboard?. We will evaluate:


How well the system understands the user's persona and financial context.

Whether user intent is inferred, not just explicitly stated.

How effectively the interface adapts to the conversation.

Whether the UI reduces cognitive effort and makes insights feel obvious.

How creatively Thesys CI is used to generate evolving, interactive UI rather than static text.

2. Reasoning & Explainability (30%) Does the system help users understand their money, not just see it?. We will evaluate:


Whether insights are grounded in clear, understandable logic.

How well patterns, anomalies, and conclusions are explained.

Whether uncertainty and assumptions are communicated honestly.

How effectively the system justifies its recommendations and follow-up questions.

3. Technical Execution (20%) Is the prototype thoughtfully built and reliable?. We will evaluate:


Clean architecture and sound technical trade-offs.

Appropriate use of models, tools, and data.
